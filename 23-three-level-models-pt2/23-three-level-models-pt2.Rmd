## Data: Housing prices in Southampton 

.midi[The data includes the price and characteristics for 918 houses sold between 1986 and 1991 in Southampton, England. The data were originally collected from a local real estate agency and were analyzed in the 1991 article ["Specifying and Estimating Multi-Level Models for Geographical Research"](https://sakai.duke.edu/access/content/group/ec265469-bdb3-47a7-beb0-317956b6f86f/jones-1991.pdf) by Kelvyn Jones. The primary variables of interest are] 

- .midi[**price**: Sales price in thousands of ] &#163;
- .midi[**Age**: Age of the house]
- .midi[**Bedrooms**: Number of bedrooms]
- .midi[**House Type**: (semi-detached, detached, bungalow, terrace, flat)]
- .midi[**Central heating**: Whether house has central heating (0: yes, 1: no)]
- .midi[**Garage**: Number of garages (none, single, double)]
- .midi[**Districts**: one of 34 districts (baseline: )]
- .midi[**Half-years**: Half-year periods beginning the second half of 1986]

## Covariance structure of observations 

---

## What we've done

So far we have discussed...

- the covariance structure between error terms at a given level, e.g. the relationship between $u_i$ and $v_i$ from a Level Two model: 

$$\left[ \begin{array}{c}
            u_{i} \\ v_{i}
          \end{array}  \right] \sim N \left( \left[
          \begin{array}{c}
            0 \\ 0
          \end{array} \right], \left[
          \begin{array}{cc}
            \sigma_{u}^{2} & \sigma_{uv} \\
            \sigma_{uv} & \sigma_{v}^{2}
          \end{array} \right] \right)$$

-  how to use the intraclass correlation coefficient to get an idea of the average correlation among observations nested in the same Level Two and/or Level Three observations

---

## Questions we want to answer

Now we want to be able to answer more specific questions about the covariance structure between *observations* at different levels. 

--

- What is the covariance structure of houses in the same district sold in different time periods? $(Y_{ij}, Y_{ij'})$

--

- What is the covariance structure of houses in the same district sold in the same time period? $(Y_{ijk}, Y_{ijk'})$

--
  - How does this structure differ between Model B and Model C in Jones (1991)?

---

## Calculating variance and covariance

Suppose $Y_1 = a_1 X_1 + a_2 X_2 + a_3$ and $Y_2 = b_1 X_1 + b_2 X_2 + b_3$ where $X_1$ and $X_2$ are random variables and $a_i$ and $b_i$ are constants for $i = 1, 2, 3$, then we know from probability theory that:

.alert[
.midi[
$${\small\begin{aligned}Var(Y_1) & = a^{2}_{1} Var(X_1) + a^{2}_{2} Var(X_2) + 2 a_1 a_2 Cov(X_1,X_2) \\[10pt]
Cov(Y_1,Y_2) & = a_1 b_1 Var(X_1) + a_2 b_2 Var(X_2) + (a_1 b_2 + a_2 b_1) Cov(X_1,X_2)\end{aligned}}$$

*Note: This extends beyond two random variables*
]
]

We will use these properties to define the covariance structure of the observations in the model. 


.footnote[.small[from [BMLR: Section 9.7.5](https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-BeyondMLR/ch-lon.html#optionalcov)]]

## Covariance structure under Model B

Let $Y_{ijk}$ be the sales price for the house $k$ in district $i$ sold in time period $j$, and $x_1, \ldots, x_9$ be the house-level covariates. 

.alert[
$$Y_{ijk} = \alpha_0 + \sum_{i = 1}^{9}\alpha_ix_i + [\tilde{u}_i + u_{ij} + \epsilon_{ijk}]$$
$$\tilde{u}_i \sim N(0, \sigma_{\tilde{u}}^2), \hspace{5mm} u_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{u}), \hspace{5mm} \epsilon_{ijk} \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$$ 
]

Only use the random effects portion of the model in the variance and covariance derivations.
