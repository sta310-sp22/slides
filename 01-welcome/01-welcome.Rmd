## Using R / RStudio

`r emo::ji("one")` Install RStudio on your laptop
  
  - [Click here](https://github.com/sta310-sp22/install-rstudio/blob/main/README.md) for instructions


**or**

`r emo::ji("two")` Access RStudio through [Docker container](https://vm-manage.oit.duke.edu/containers) provided by Duke OIT
  - Reserve a generic **RStudio** container (there is no course specific container)
