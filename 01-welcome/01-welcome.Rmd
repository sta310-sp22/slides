## Generalized Linear Models

*In statistics, a generalized linear model (GLM) is a flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression. The GLM generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a link function and by allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value.*

## What we're covering this semester 

**Generalized Linear Models (Ch 1 - 6)**

- Introduce models for non-normal response variables
- Estimation, interpretation, and inference
- Mathematical details showing how GLMs are connected

**Modeling correlated data (Ch 7 - 11)**

- Introduce multilevel models for correlated and longitudinal data
- Estimation, interpretation, and inference
- Mathematical details, particularly diving into covariance structures

## Meet your classmates! (6 minutes)

- Quick introductions - Name and year
- Choose a reporter
  - Need help choosing? Person with birthday closest to January 5. 
- Identify 8 things everyone in the group has in common
  - Not being a Duke student
  - Not clothes (we're all wearing socks)
  - Not body parts (we all have a nose)

<br>

**Reporter will share list with the class**

## Using R / RStudio

`r emo::ji("one")` Install RStudio on your laptop
  
  - [Click here](https://github.com/sta310-sp22/computing/blob/main/README.md) for instructions


**or**

`r emo::ji("two")` Access RStudio through [Docker container](https://vm-manage.oit.duke.edu/containers) provided by Duke OIT
  - Reserve a generic **RStudio** container (there is no course specific container)
